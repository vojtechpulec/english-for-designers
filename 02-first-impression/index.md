## First Impression

My name is **Vojtěch Pulec** and I am a **student of graphic design** at the University of Creative Communication in Prague, Czech Republic.

Throughout my life, I have always liked to create something. Slowly, I started to care about how things in the world around us look. 

When my designer journey began, as I started studying Graphic Design in high school, I started to form my point of view on what truly matters to me in not only my craft but also the things that I meet every day around me.

As I mentioned in my **Design manifesto** (link), everything around us was created by someone, and **everyone who creates is a designer.** But my ideology of good design (not just in form on graphics) is generating a **deeper meaning of things,** something more than just a surface-level beauty. The shallow look of things is very important too, but it cant work on its own.

Design for me is a way to share an **authentic expression of yourself** as an author. But also **make the world around us look, and work better.**
