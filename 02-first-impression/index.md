## üëã Hi!

My name is **Vojtƒõch Pulec** and I am a **graphic designer.**


Throughout my life, I have always liked to create something. Slowly, I started to care about how things in the world around us look.¬†

When my designer journey began, as I started studying Graphic Design in high school, I started to form my point of view on what truly matters to me in not only my craft but also the things that I meet every day around me.

> ‚ÄúEverything is designed. Few things are designed well.‚Äù 
¬† ‚Äì *Brian Reed*

As I mentioned in my **[Design manifesto](https://github.com/vojtechpulec/english-for-designers/blob/main/01-design-manifesto/index.md)**, everything around us was created by someone, and **everyone who creates is a designer.** But my ideology of good design (not just in the form of graphics) is generating a **deeper meaning of things,** something more than just surface-level beauty. The shallow look of things is very important too, but it can't work on its own.

Design for me is a way to share an **authentic expression of yourself** as an author. But also **make the world around us look, and work better.** I'm curretly finishing my last year of the Graphic and media design bachelor's program at the Prague School of Creative Communication. My projects were and are mostly focused on **identities, logos, socials, icons, etc.**, but I'm interested in all kinds of creative projects. I enjoy not only working on the visual side but also on the **idea-making and content.**

## Caf√© & Klub Letka
When you think of "beautiful and cozy caf√©," you might be imaginating the interior of Caf√© Letka, located at Letn√°, Prague.

I believe that every beautiful thing deserves to be presented in the very same fashion. The logo stands on the main attribute of the interior of the caf√©, which are arcs. They are everywhere, at the main entrance, windows, even on top of the large mirror that is one of the first things you see after the entrance. The whole space has a young and fresh soul, even while being vintage on the surface.

The logo represents the young soul of the caf√© via the simple custom sans font, with the elements of the vintage arcs in the letters, creating symbiosis of fresh and old school, just like the space itself.

## FAMUFEST 40: S√çTƒö
FAMUFEST is a student film festival which takes place anually at the FAMU University in Prague, this year with topic focused on the neuron webs.

Have you ever thought about the similarities between the internet, digital webs, and the webs of neurons inside of our brains? They have so much in common, and thats exactly what the visiual showcases. The only difference is that only one of those is able to generate emotions and the other one not, or is it? 

The whole visual stands on AI generated images in bitmap reflecting the net. The images are showcasing various emotions through human eyes. Eyes are the gate to the peoples mind, and showcases all hints of emotions. Those images are suppported  with the autentic patterns related to the individual emotion, its strength and character formed into the logo of FAMUFEST.
