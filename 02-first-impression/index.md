## Hi!üëã

My name is **Vojtƒõch Pulec** and I am a **graphic designer.**


Throughout my life, I have always liked to create something. Slowly, I started to care about how things in the world around us look.¬†

When my designer journey began, as I started studying Graphic Design in high school, I started to form my point of view on what truly matters to me in not only my craft but also the things that I meet every day around me.

As I mentioned in my **[Design manifesto](https://github.com/vojtechpulec/english-for-designers/blob/main/01-design-manifesto/index.md)**, everything around us was created by someone, and **everyone who creates is a designer.** But my ideology of good design (not just in form on graphics) is generating a **deeper meaning of things,** something more than just a surface-level beauty. The shallow look of things is very important too, but it cant work on its own.

Design for me is a way to share an **authentic expression of yourself** as an author. But also **make the world around us look, and work better.** I'm curretly finishing my last year of Graphic and media design at Prague School of Creative Communication. My projects are mostly focused on **identities, logos, socials, icons, etc.**, but I'm interested in all kinds of and creative projects. I enjoy not only working on the visual side, but also on the **ideamaking and content.**
