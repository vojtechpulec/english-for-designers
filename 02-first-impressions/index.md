# üëã Hello! I'm Vojtƒõch Pulec,

a young **graphic designer** based near Prague. Apart from design, I'm tapped into **music and fashion.** I enjoy gaming in my free time, and I'm also an Arsenal fan.

## Something more about me:

Hi, Vojta here again! I'm curretly finishing my last year of the Graphic and media design bachelor's program at the Prague School of Creative Communication. Design for me is a way to share an **authentic expression of yourself** as an author. But also **make the world around us look, and work better.**

> ‚ÄúEverything is designed. Few things are designed well.‚Äù ‚Äî *Brian Reed*

Everything around us was created by someone, and **everyone who creates is a designer.** But my ideology of good design (not just in the form of graphics) is generating a **deeper meaning of things,** something more than just surface-level beauty. The shallow look of things is very important too, but it can't work long-term on its own. Just like I mention in my **[Design manifesto](https://github.com/vojtechpulec/english-for-designers/blob/main/01-design-manifesto/index.md)**. 


# Featured projects:
Most of my projects were and are focused on **visual identities and visuals for promotional design,** apart from that i also have slight experience with typesetting and some basics of UI/UX design. I'm interested in all kinds of creative projects, not just from the visual side, but I also enjoy **idea-making and content creation.** 

## Caf√© & Klub Letka - Rebranding
**2024 // VISUAL IDENTITY**

![letka-mockup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fba0add3-2685-4979-b47c-2d75b60bdd09)
When you think of "beautiful and cozy caf√©," you might imagine the interior of Caf√© Letka, located in Letn√°, Prague.

The design of the logo stands on the main attribute of the caf√©'s interior ‚Äî arcs. They are everywhere, at the main entrance, windows, or even the top of the large mirror right in front of the entrance. The whole space has a young and fresh soul, even while being vintage on the surface.

New visual identity represents the young soul of the caf√© via the simple custom sans font, with the elements of the vintage arcs in the letters, creating symbiosis of freshness and old school, just like the caf√© itself.
