## üëã Hi!

I'm Vojtƒõch Pulec, a young **graphic designer** based near Prague. I enjoy the creative process and getting inspired by creative solutions. Apart from design, I'm tapped into **music and fashion.** I'm also an Arsenal fan, and i enjoy gaming in my free time.

## About Vojtƒõch Pulec

Hi, Vojta here again! I'm curretly finishing my last year of the Graphic and media design bachelor's program at the Prague School of Creative Communication. Design for me is a way to share an **authentic expression of yourself** as an author. But also **make the world around us look, and work better.**

> ‚ÄúEverything is designed. Few things are designed well.‚Äù ‚Äî *Brian Reed*

As I mentioned in my **[Design manifesto](https://github.com/vojtechpulec/english-for-designers/blob/main/01-design-manifesto/index.md)**, everything around us was created by someone, and **everyone who creates is a designer.** But my ideology of good design (not just in the form of graphics) is generating a **deeper meaning of things,** something more than just surface-level beauty. The shallow look of things is very important too, but it can't work long-term on its own.

<!--Throughout my life, I have always liked to create something. Slowly, I started to care about how things in the world around us look.¬†

My designer journey began, as I started studying graphic design in high school. There I started to form my point of view on what truly matters to me in not only my craft but also the things that I meet every day around me. -->


## Take a look at some of my projects:
Most of my projects were and are focused on **visual identities and visuals for social media**, but I'm interested in all kinds of creative projects. I enjoy not only working on the visual side but also on the **idea-making and content.** 

## Caf√© & Klub Letka - Redesign
**2024 // VISUAL IDENTITY**

![letka](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee8d5542-1bdd-4592-9042-027f16755456)
When you think of "beautiful and cozy caf√©," you might be imaginating the interior of Caf√© Letka, located at Letn√°, Prague.

I believe that every beautiful thing deserves to be presented in the very same fashion. The logo stands on the main attribute of the interior of the caf√©, which are arcs. They are everywhere, at the main entrance, windows, even on top of the large mirror that is one of the first things you see after the entrance. The whole space has a young and fresh soul, even while being vintage on the surface.

The logo represents the young soul of the caf√© via the simple custom sans font, with the elements of the vintage arcs in the letters, creating symbiosis of fresh and old school, just like the space itself.

<!-- make it shorter, before and after of the logo? -->



## FAMUFEST 40: S√çTƒö
**2023  //  IDEA MAKING  //  VISUALS  //  POSTERS**

![famufest40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64866c90-e4df-4c4b-8962-7901f3373adf)
FAMUFEST is a student film festival which takes place anually at the FAMU University in Prague, this time with theme focused on the neuron webs.

Have you ever thought about the similarities between the digital webs on the internet, and the webs of neurons inside of our brains? They have so much in common, and thats exactly what our visiual is based on. The main difference is that only one of those is able to generate emotions and the other one not, right? 

The whole visual stands on AI generated images in bitmap reflecting the net. The images are showcasing various emotions through human eyes. Eyes are the gate to the peoples mind, and showcases all hints of emotions. Those images are suppported  with the autentic patterns related to the individual emotion, its strength and character formed into the logo of FAMUFEST.


## Set of pictograms for Prague Congress Centre
**2023  //  PICTOGRAM CREATION**

![pcc_icons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a72e6c50-a370-4672-9a9d-6a465a41a0db)
It was my first time ever working on the all rounded set of pictograms, as a atelier school project.

While thinking and sketching the pictograms for the Prague Congress Centre, the most important things that we came up with, is the unique brutalist architecture of the building and a sharp arrows in the logo. These two things kind of created the character of the pictograms. We tried to reflect the elements of the arrows from the logo, creating the rough, brutalist vibe, matching the profile of Prague Congress Centre.
