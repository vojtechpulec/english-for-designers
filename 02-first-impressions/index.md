# üëã Hello! I'm Vojtƒõch Pulec,

a young **graphic designer** based near Prague. Apart from design, I'm tapped into **music and fashion.** I'm also an Arsenal fan, and i enjoy gaming in my free time.

## Something more about me:

Hi, Vojta here again! I'm curretly finishing my last year of the Graphic and media design bachelor's program at the Prague School of Creative Communication. Design for me is a way to share an **authentic expression of yourself** as an author. But also **make the world around us look, and work better.**

> ‚ÄúEverything is designed. Few things are designed well.‚Äù ‚Äî *Brian Reed*

Everything around us was created by someone, and **everyone who creates is a designer.** But my ideology of good design (not just in the form of graphics) is generating a **deeper meaning of things,** something more than just surface-level beauty. The shallow look of things is very important too, but it can't work long-term on its own. Just like I mention in my **[Design manifesto](https://github.com/vojtechpulec/english-for-designers/blob/main/01-design-manifesto/index.md)**. 


# Featured projects:
Most of my projects were and are focused on **visual identities and visuals for social media**, but I'm interested in all kinds of creative projects. I enjoy not only working on the visual side but also on the **idea-making and content.** 

## Caf√© & Klub Letka - Rebranding
**2024 // VISUAL IDENTITY**

![letkabeforeafter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01c183e-2783-425b-be52-3f3a6d24edd5)
When you think of "beautiful and cozy caf√©," you might imagine the interior of Caf√© Letka, located in Letn√°, Prague.

The design of the logo stands on the main attribute of the caf√©'s interior ‚Äî arcs. They are everywhere, at the main entrance, windows, or even the top of the large mirror right in front of the entrance. The whole space has a young and fresh soul, even while being vintage on the surface.

New visual identity represents the young soul of the caf√© via the simple custom sans font, with the elements of the vintage arcs in the letters, creating symbiosis of freshness and old school, just like the caf√© itself.

Prague Congress centre is unique by its brutalist achritecture.

Our set of pictograms tries to combine buildings essential brutalism elements with the sharp arrows in the logo of the PCC. The combination creates the rough, brutalist vibe, matching the buildings interior and exterior, while working well with their current logo.
