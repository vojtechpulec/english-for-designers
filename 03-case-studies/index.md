## Café Letka Rebranding - Case study
# Enhancing visual identity of the dream place to drink coffee at
When you think of "beautiful and cozy café," you might imagine the interior and atmosphere of Café Letka, located in Letná, Prague.
The vibe of café is outstanding and so its brand identity deserves to represent the place accordingly.

### What was the bad bean?
- The first, most obvious thing you look at is the old logo. The logo is cute, but the cuteness is maybe the only thing it has in common with the place itself. It is not really visible anywhere, as the café represents themselves just by it looks, so everyone knows the place by its look, not by its logo. On the other hand, the café also has its club, called Klub Letka, where all kinds of events takes place. The logo of the club doesnt match with café logo, nor with the atmosphere.

### Our brewing process
- When I got into the sketching process, trying to figure out new logo, all I had in mind is associating the logo with the interior. When you visit the place, arcs are screaming from everywhere! The hallway doors, entrance to both café and club, windows, or the giant pink mirror opposite the entrance. It almost seems like THAT is their identity, so lets work with that!

- Another thing that clics together is the fact that this idea of bringing the “doors etc.” into the logo works well with another espresso bar Letec. The bar has the same owner and is located just couple kilometers away, considered as fellow subsidiary. Logo of Letec is corresponding with the idea of representing the interior and doorway, as another detail that supports the meaning of our rebranding.

### Creation of our favourite café
- I was trying to figure out how to work with the arc symbols in the typography, because at the same time I wanted the logo to be as simple and clean as possible. Since the café is working mainly with its interior, I wanted the logo to be just a another component, but representative enough, to be memorable and functional more than the old logo. (And I also got rid of the plane from the old logo, as it serves no real purpose besides shallow connection with the name of the café.)

- Another goal was to make the logo match more with the logo of Klub Letka. So present two matching logos, or one that works better with the current logo of the club, in case owner wouldnt change the identity of Klub Letka.

### Serving
- The logo I came up with as a final version has everything I set at the beginning of the process. Its clean typography that doesnt scream, highlighting the arcs in the letters, as the main and the most memorable element of the café. The custom sans font itself represents the fresh and young soul that the place breathes. It works well in contrast of the vintage look of the place, which can also be interpreted in the arcs, highlighted in the letters. All the aspects included creates symbiosis of freshness and old school, just like the café itself.

- The same font and technique was applied for the new logo of Klub Letka, giving a option to promote both places in one logo, under the name Letka, that both of them carries. But also works fine being combined with the current logo of the club, unlike the old Café Letka logo.

- And alongside the new logo, we brought more ideas to connect the branding into the identity.  Brand new menus: using combination of sans and serif fonts Bitter and Raleway, working well with the logo, showcasing the mentioned symbiosis. And couple more detailes as branded takeaway products. From food boxes, coffee cups etc., to cards for the frequent customers featuring rewards and bonuses. Last but not least a simple navigation system including pictograms for toilets etc.
