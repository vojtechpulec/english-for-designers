Hello! My name is **Vojtěch Pulec** and I'am a graphic designer living in Kralupy nad Vltavou, a pretty small city just a short ride from Prague.

If you’ve ever caught me zoning out, chances are I was thinking about clothes, Arsenal’s latest match, analyzing a poster, or getting lost deep in my current music rotation. The odds of me being tapped into at least one of these things at any given moment? **Very high.**

I’ve always liked making things. When I was a kid, I didn’t call it "design." I just knew I cared about how things looked, how they felt, and how they worked together. Drawing, building stuff, and all buncg of creative activities were my thing.   That’s why choosing a graphic design high school felt like the obvious step for me (with art school results coming out earlier, so I didn’t even have to bother with backup plans).  
As I already said, I wasn’t thinking about myself as a graphic designer yet, but going this way was for sure a good decision. I slowly coompletely found myself in it. Through those school years and projects, I learned the basics of the craft. More importantly, I began figuring out what I actually liked and explore my taste, what I like and what excites me. Not just in visual design itself. 

All my hobbies, such as music, fashion, or even gaming doesn’t distract me from design, they are feeding it. I love blending different spheres into one creative mix. Using inspiration from one thing in another, or casually finding visual aspects in whatever makes me happy.  

And if I’ve learned anything throughout this journey so far, it’s to never stop exploring and to stay curious. About people, cultures, aesthetics, sounds, whatever excites you. Let the things that you like inspire you in your craft.
