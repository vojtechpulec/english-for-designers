## Hello everyone!
### My name is Vojta,
a graphic designer based near Prague,

if you’ve ever caught me zoning out, I was most likely thinking about clothes, Arsenal’s latest match, analyzing a poster, or getting lost in my current music rotation.

Chances of me being tapped into at least one of these at the given moment?   
**Very high.**

I would like to tell you something about the 
### Inspiration and Influence (in design and beyond)  

But first things first, let me tell you something about **My “design” path:**

Since I was a kid, I always loved creating things,  
**but I didn’t call it "design" yet.**

**That’s why choosing a graphic design high school felt like the obvious step.**  
*(+ with art school results coming out earlier, I didn’t even have to bother with any backup plans)*

- That’s where I realized **I care about how things around me look, feel and work.**

Now lets come back to:
## The Inspiration and Influence

### Everyone evolves.
**As a person** and obviously also **as a designer**

**I slowly found myself.**
I started figuring out **what truly excites me, what resonates with my taste and identity.**

And I figured out, that stuff that I like outside of design,   
*such as music, fashion, sports or even video games*
they don’t distract me,  
**they feed my creativity.**

### Today I see design everywhere,
and I try to find the inspiration in whatever I like.

- *various fashion related campaigns, posts and posters*

These things might look a bit random,   
but hese are my references — not always from design, but **they inform my design.**

## Blend the worlds
It’s not about separating interests. It’s about letting them all play a role.
### Let the things you love inspire you and fuel new ideas

## Stay curious. 
### Stay connected to what you love.  
Your personal passions are not just hobbies,  
they are **the fuel for your most authentic creative work.**  

**To be yourself.**
