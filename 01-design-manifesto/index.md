# My design manifesto

### Everyone can be a designer

In my opinion **every human act of creation is a form of design.**
From the imagination and visualisation in peoples minds, to converting the ideas into the function in the real world: such as a everyday objects we use, text, visual art, machines, even speeches and music, or any other form of creation we can think about. 
**Design is a form of expressing yourself** and your ideas, while making people think, and get inspired by your craft.

### Graphic design

But when it comes to the topic of "design" among people, most of them think of **graphic design, or visuals in general.**
For every visual creation, its important to be eye catching, and draw peoples attention by a sight. Just a great visual is obviously great, but i believe that enhancing the „shallow“ looks with other aspects, that unfolds in time, and gives the „viewer“ something to think about and explore little more in depth, **gives the design its meaning and soul,** and creates, in my opion, all rounded, and good design. These hidden messages carry authenticity of you (the creator), or the thing itself,  It can carry emotions, history, opinions, or just a good and creative way of multiple things working together unorthodox way. 

To achieve this, **it usually reqires a passion and ability to understand the topic.** So as a little bit of empathy for those, you create for and ability to predict their aproach for the craft. See what they like, but at the same time being able to be different than the others, and to always try to be yourself.
